Today, I learned how to insert image, color, and text. and explored more JS functions. we spent enough time to master github and leaned how to fork, pull and push anyone's file and rework on it. Our instructor showed us how to manuplate github repeatedly and wanted to make sure no one is left behind. Our lab 5 mostly is focused on github. we're going to fork,pull and push files from github. exciting!!
