Journal 5
Today I learned lots of concepts which I have been strugling resolving my self. lab 4 was pair programming! a fantastic team work where you share each ones code through Github, and share your ideas and know if you are behind the assgnments and other related instructions. 
when you work as pair with other developer, you feel more lighter than bothering the teacher. I learned some technique of coding from my partener and helped me evaluate my pace during this first week. 
tonight I will be spending working and toching my website on the Html and CSS level. we jointly (with my partener) worked on multiple correct answers on the guessing game.
