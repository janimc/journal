todya I learned,
How a Dom is creates and how the browser contlols the created html page and how java can access and update the content of the page while it's in the browsers window.
another important think I learned during this class is how a for loop function helps to go to each noelist created.
traversing Nodes is another interesting thin I learned between parentNode,previouSibling and firstChild and lasChild. based ont he above lessons learned, we're assigned to create a website for small shop and create a constructor along the html and how you can call each elementNode.
